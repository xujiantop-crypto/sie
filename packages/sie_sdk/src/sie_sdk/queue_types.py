    Attributes:
        work_item_id: Unique ID for this work item. Format: ``{request_id}.{item_index}``.
        request_id: Unique ID for the originating client request. Format: ``{router_id}-{counter}``.
        item_index: Position of this item in the original request (for result ordering).
        total_items: Total number of items in the original request.
        operation: Inference operation: ``"encode"`` | ``"score"`` | ``"extract"``, or
            ``"load"`` for an item without input that only asks the worker to load the model.
        model_id: Model identifier (e.g., ``"BAAI/bge-m3"``).
        profile_id: Profile name (e.g., ``"default"``).
        display_model: The model id the caller asked for, when the gateway dispatched the
            work to another route of it, such as a profile variant. Absent otherwise.
        pool_name: Target pool (e.g., ``"default"``).
        machine_profile: Required GPU type (e.g., ``"l4"``). Workers validate this.
        bundle_config_hash: Expected bundle config hash from the gateway's ModelRegistry.
            Workers compare this against their own computed hash and NAK items with
            mismatched hashes so they are redelivered to updated workers.

        item: Inline item payload (text, small images). Mutually exclusive with ``payload_ref``.
        payload_ref: S3 key for offloaded payload. Mutually exclusive with ``item``.

        output_types: Encode: which outputs to return (``["dense", "sparse"]``).
        instruction: Optional instruction for instruction-tuned models.
        is_query: Encode: whether items are queries (True) or documents (False).
        options: Runtime options (lora, pooling, output_dtype, etc.).

        query_item: Score: the query item (inline).
        query_payload_ref: Score: S3 key for offloaded query payload.
        score_items: Score: all candidate items (inline list).

        labels: Extract: entity labels.
        output_schema: Extract: structured output schema.

        router_id: Originating gateway identifier (for observability).
        reply_subject: NATS subject where the worker should publish results.
        timestamp: Unix timestamp when the work item was created.
        deadline: Absolute Unix timestamp, on the clock that stamps ``timestamp``,
            after which no caller waits for this item. Absent when unknown.
        fallback_reason: Present when the gateway sent the item to a remote profile in place of
            a local route that refused it; names the refusal. The worker answers such an item
            with an error result when the backend requests a retry. Admission and
            readiness barriers retain their existing retry behavior.

        The encoding is **not fully reversible**. Model IDs containing

    Worker IDs flow into three places that all share the same wire contract:

    * the gateway's direct-dispatch publish subject
      (``sie.work.{pool}.{machine_profile}.{bundle}.{model}.{worker_id}``),
    * the per-worker JetStream stream subjects
      (``sie.work.{pool}.{machine_profile}.{bundle}.*.{worker_id}``), and
    * the durable consumer name (``gen-{worker_id}``).

    In production, worker IDs come from ``SIE_WORKER_ID`` / ``HOSTNAME`` /
    ``POD_NAME``. Kubernetes pod hostnames (e.g.
    ``sie-worker-7d9f-default-0.sie-worker.default.svc``) contain ``.``
    which is the NATS subject separator — interpolating that raw value
    expands the subject into extra tokens and the gateway and worker bind
    to different subjects, silently breaking direct-dispatch.

    This helper applies the **same** mapping as :func:`normalize_model_id`
    (matching the Rust gateway's ``normalize_model_id`` in
    ``packages/sie_gateway/src/queue/publisher.rs``), so the two sides
    always produce identical subject tokens. Empty input — and input that
    normalizes to the empty string — is rejected: silently substituting a
    default (the previous ``or "worker"`` fallback) caused durable-consumer
    collisions across processes when env vars were missing.
